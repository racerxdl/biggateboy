# Big Gate Boy

Work in progress Big FPGA Gameboy made with an Lattice ECP5 FPGA and few LED Panels

# Live streaming

This project is currently being done in livestream sessions at twitch tv. Please visit https://twitch.tv/racerxdl :D - Most of the livestream public is portuguese speaker, but I can answer questions in english as well.


# Tests

I'm doing the CPU tests pretty much like I did for [riskow](https://github.com/racerxdl/riskow): Simple assembly code that tests each group of instructions. They're in testdata folder. There is some description on how to use them if you want to use them in your project. See [Test Data](testdata/README.md)

# License

I'm doing this back to the community that contributed with money to make this happen. So everything here is Apache2 License except for the Gameboy / Color BIOS. If you're making money out of this project or use in something interesting please let me know (I like FPGA projects) and consider making a tip: https://lucasteske.dev/donate
